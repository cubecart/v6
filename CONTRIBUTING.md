# Contributing

First of all THANK YOU! All contributions be it bug fix, reporting an issue or features request; we greatly appreciate your time which helps make CubeCart even better. 

## Feature Requests
Please note that we close ALL new feature requests. This doesn't mean we won't implement them but it means they may well be opened at a later date and assigned to a milestone.

## Sponsored Feature Requests

## Bug Reports
Please provide an overview of the issue with steps to reproduce. If you have forked CubeCart we appreciate pull requests to review. The GitHub issue tracker is NOT a source to seek technical support. Instead please contact our support staff via the [helpdesk](https://support.cubecart.com/Tickets/Submit).

## Security Issues
This is a sensitive area and we would request that they are not posted to GitHub publicly. Instead please submit your findings with proof of concept to our sale staff on the [helpdesk](https://support.cubecart.com/Tickets/Submit).
